        <p>* Joseph Engelberger is widely considered the "Father of Robotics" for developing the first industrial robot, the Unimate, and co-founding the world's first robotics company, Unimation. 
            His work in the 1950s and 60s transformed the concept of robots into a commercial industry by adapting George Devol's invention for practical manufacturing applications. </p>
        <p>* Robotics is an interdisciplinary field of engineering and science that combines mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering to design, build, and operate robots. 
            Robots are programmable machines that can perform tasks traditionally done by humans, often for increased efficiency, safety, or to operate in hazardous environments. 
            Key aspects include robotics relies on sensors, actuators, and control systems to interact with their environment, with the integration of artificial intelligence enabling more complex behaviors and decision-making. </p>
